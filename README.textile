h1. Linccer API for Android

h2. Description  

The Android Linccer binding provides a UI thread aware variant of the Java API to communicate with the RESTful Linccer Services:

bc.. 
AsyncLinccer linccer = 
      new AsyncLinccer(new ClientDescription("Demo Android App"));

// publish a gps position obtained from Android's LocationListener
linccer.onGpsChanged(location);

// publish a wifi data obtained from Android's WifiManager
wifiManager = (WifiManager) pContext.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
linccer.onWifiScanResults(wifiManager.getScanResults());

// creating and Android event handler to give user feedback
Handler handler = new Handler() {
            @Override
            public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                  String toast = "transfer failed";
                  if (msg.what == AsyncLinccer.MessageType.SHARED)
                     toastMessage = "sharing faild";
                  else if (msg.what == AsyncLinccer.MessageType.RECEIVED)
                     toastMessage = "received " + (JSONObject) msg.obj;
                  
                  Toast.makeText(this, toastMessage, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
         };

// safely pass data to an other client here and now
linccer.asyncShare("one-to-one", 
                    new JSONObject("{ 'demo' : 'arbitrary json' }"), 
                    handler);

// safely receive passed data from an other client here and now
linccer.asyncReceive("one-to-one", handler);

p. More examples can soon be found in the samples folder.

h2. Install and try out

* download the provided "Android Library Project":https://github.com/hoccer/android-api/archives/master
* make sure you have the latest ADT Eclipse plugin. Previous versions had problems with library projects containing a dash in the project name
* start a new Android Project and add the Linccer Android-API project as a Library Project

h2. Deployment

* obtain your own API Key from "developer.hoccer.com":http://developer.hoccer.com
* use a ClientConfig constructor apiKey and sharedSecret parameters
* change service base from sandbox.hoccer.com to hoccer.com

h2. Remarks

Also have a look at the Linccer Java-API which is included as a GIT submodule in this project. If you want to "git clone" this code directly from GitHub, remember to update the submodule with

bc. git submodule update --init
